    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project revolves around the process of parsing an XML file into a structured DataFrame, followed by thorough data auditing and cleaning. The primary challenge involved in this integration task was the initial parsing of the XML data using the BeautifulSoup library. During this phase, a strategy was implemented to assign a null value to the 'Source' attribute if a record was not encapsulated within a 'Source' tag to ensure that any records lacking a source were handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the XML file's structure, the data was parsed and transformed into a pandas DataFrame. One noteworthy issue encountered was the formatting of date values in the YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS format. To address this, the datetime library was used to convert these dates into the desired YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format. Some dates caused an error because they were in the YYYYDDMMTHHMMSS format, so conditional statements were used for proper conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next phase focused on data cleansing. Each column in the DataFrame was checked against the specifications provided in the assignment description. The 'astype' method was used in assigning their appropriate data types. 'value_counts' helped in identifying possible misspelled words within the data. Challenges were encountered during the conversion of the 'Salary' column to float due to the presence of strings. To resolve this, 'k'-appended values were modified to reflect thousands ('000'). Range representations such as \"to,\" \"-\", \"~,\" and \"\" were resolved by preserving the higher value. Similarly, strings like \"per year,\" \"/year,\" and \"per Annum\" were removed from 'Salary' entries, leaving only the numeric value. Following these adjustments, the 'Salary' column was successfully transformed into float format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address missing values, various placeholders like \"N/A,\" \"None,\" \"\", and \"-\" were replaced by \"non-specified\" across the columns in mentioned in the assignment description. The detection of outliers in the Salary column were performed using a box plot, with identified outliers being subsequently removed from the DataFrame. The integrity constraints of the data were upheld by verifying that 'OpenDate' values preceded corresponding 'CloseDate' values. When discrepancies were identified, 'OpenDate' and 'CloseDate' values were switched to ensure data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the 'Source' column was subjected to a consistency check. While the majority of entries represented websites, a subset were just company names. To rectify this inconsistency, websites were obtained from the internet and matched for these entries, effectively aligning the data."

    "In this project, the task involved parsing XML data into a DataFrame, followed by comprehensive data auditing and cleaning. The process began by tackling challenges with XML parsing, such as identifying the correct structure of the XML file. Dates were standardized, and the data was transformed into a structured DataFrame. Data cleansing included datatype conversion, handling misspelled words, and resolving issues in the 'Salary' column. Missing values were standardized, outliers were detected and removed, and data integrity constraints were maintained for date ranges. The 'Source' column was checked for consistency, with non-website entries updated accordingly.Lastly, complete duplicates were dealt with by dropping the rows. This project highlighted the significance of meticulous data handling and quality assurance."
